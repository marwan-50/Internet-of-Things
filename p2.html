<h2>Some of the advantages of IoT include the following:</h2>
<p>1.ability to access information from anywhere at any time on any device.</p>
<p>2.improved communication between connected electronic devices.</p>
<p>3.transferring data packets over a connected network saving time and money.</p>
<p>4.automating tasks helping to improve the quality of a business's services and reducing the need for human intervention.</p>
<h2>Some disadvantages of IoT include the following:</h2>
<p>1.As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices, the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases.</p>
<p>2.Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers -- maybe even millions -- of IoT devices, and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging.</p>
